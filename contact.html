                        If you have a question, feel free to ask! We're happy to answer your questions.

                        If you have a bug to report, please make sure to include screenshots <i>and</i> steps to recreate the issue in your message.
                        Without this information, it's hard for us to recreate and diagnose the issue.

                        If you have a suggestion, please go ahead and send it! We're looking for new things to add every day, and any input or ideas are appreciated.

                        The most preferred way for you to contact us would be on Discord. It's the place that we're checking most,
                        so if you have to contact us for any reason, this is the best place for you to do it. You can join the Drap's Labs Discord server
                        <a href="https://discord.gg/XRxCd4kME3">here,</a>
                        or you can message us directly. The Staff links on the
                        <a href="./about#staff">About page</a>
                        are also clickable, and will open our profile in a new window.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <i>However,</i> if for whatever reason you are unable or don't want to contact us through discord, we are also reachable through email.
                        <b>Please Note:</b> an email will have a slower response time than a direct message simply because it isn't cheched as often,
                        however, it is still very much an option. Emailing will send a message to both of us, and we will try to reply as soon as possible.
                        <br>
                        We are reachable at: <a href="mailto:help@drapadon.org">help@drapadon.org</a>.
