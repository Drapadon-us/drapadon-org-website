            <h4 style="text-align: center;">Jellyfin is used to manage, play, and share personal media libraries like movies, TV shows, music, and photos by streaming them to various devices on a local network or remotely.</h4><br>

                <p><strong>Accessing the Web Portal</strong></p>
                <p style="padding-left: 2vw;">
                    <small>
                        To access the JellyFin server, click
                        <a href="https://jellyfin.drapadon.org">here</a>.
                        You'll be directed to a login screen, where you can enter in the login information provided to you in dms from a Jellyfin manager.
                        <u>You only get 3 attempts at signing in before it disables your account. If this happens ping a Jellyfin Manager.</u>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <i>Note that this login information is <u>your eyes only.</u> Sharing this information will result a removal from the Jellyfin server, and possibly removal of access from the entire server!</i>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After you login, you should see three things: Movies, Shows, and Books. Select one, then it'll open a whole array of movies, shows, or books (depending on what you selected). To access the media you want to view, press on the play button.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Do keep in mind that you can only have 2 seeions active per user. This means if you try to connect to the server on 3 devices, the third device will not connect to the server, and will return an error.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <i>Note that if your watching gets interrupted, your place will be saved as long and you're 5 percent into a movie or episode. Books are a different story, and Jellyfin will save your spot as long as you flip one page.</i>

                        You can join the Drap's Labs Discord server
                        <a href="https://discord.gg/XRxCd4kME3">here.</a>
                        The Discord server is optional. However, this server will update you on the status of the server, like downtimes, new media, and ect.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Opon joining, if you do not get assigned the Jellyfin access role, then please ping the same jellyfin Manager who provided your password.

                <p style="padding-left: 2vw;">
                     <small>
                        It's VERY recommended to change your password after you login for the first time. The provided password from a Jellyfin Manager is supposed to be a temporary password, and is not secure.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        To change your password, follow these three steps: 3 lines in the top left -> settings -> profile -> enter current password -> enter new password + confirmation.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Please note that if you forgot your password, you can dm a Jellyfin Manager and they'll reset it for you.</b>
                     </small>
                </p>

                     <small>
                        If you encounter a jellyfin problem, like a fatal playback error, please ping a Jellyfin Manager in the Discord server.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If you encounter a Cloudflare error, ping a Server Manager.
