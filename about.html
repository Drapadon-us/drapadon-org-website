                <p style="padding-left: 2vw;">
                    <small>
                        Drap's Labs originally started as a NAS home server set up by Drapadon for
                        file storage purposes. Eventually, he installed TrueNAS on it, and the server
                        expanded into a Jellyfin Media Server.
                    </small>

                    <small>
                        However, the hardware it ran on was old and ran very slow, so in April of 2025,
                        he upgraded to a better and more powerful server. Around this time, Drapadon also bought
                        our domain, and that's when we realised we could use the server to host more things.
                    </small>

                    <small>
                        The 'projects' portion of our site really kicked off when Digytt asked to create DigyttPlace, a
                        personal r/Place clone project. More people began to use the server, and from then on we began
                        coming up with more ideas for projects.
                    </small>
                    <br>
                    <small>
                        We also created a Discord server where we could tell our users about the status of Jellyfin, but
                        then it expanded into a hub where we can talk about and share our projects.
                    </small>

                    <small>
                        We eventually decided to create a mainpage for our base domain! We had originally stolen the code from Jalen,
                        however that was boring. So, we began development of this very page, made completely with our own code.

                    <br>
                    <small>
                        And now, Drap's Labs lives on as a place for new projects whenever we feel like trying or making something.
                        Thank you, the users, for your support with this project. It means a lot to us.
