                    <small>
                        Drap's Labs originally started as a NAS home server set up by Drapadon for
                        file storage purposes. Eventually, Drapadon installed TrueNAS, and the server
                        expanded into a Jellyfin Media Server.

                    <small>
                        However, the hardware it ran on was old and ran very slow, so in April of 2025,
                        Drapadon upgraded to a better and more powerful server. Around this time, Drapadon also bought
                        one of the first domains for Drap's Labs. That's when Drapadon realised he could use the server to host
                        more things.

                    <small>
                        The projects portion of Drap's Labs site really kicked off when Digytt asked Drapadon to create DigyttPlace, a
                        personal r/Place clone project. More people began to use the server, and from then on Drapadon began
                        coming up with more ideas for projects.
                    </small>
                    <br>
                    <small>
                        Drap's Labs then got its own Discord server, where users could see the status of Jellyfin, but
                        then it expanded into a hub where people can talk.

                    <small>
                        Drap's Labs then decided to create a mainpage for the base domain, however the code was stolen from another person.
                        So, Drap's Labs began development of this very page, made completely with their own code.

                    <small>
                        And now, Drap's Labs lives on as a place for new projects whenever Drapadon feels like attempting/creating projects.
